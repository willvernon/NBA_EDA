# Change in the NBA

Lots of reports of a drop in viewership in the NBA. Many of the talking heads and other fans saying its because of the play of basketball for the reason for drop of viewership.

I am going to first get all the stats for the past 5 seasons and see if there is a drop in viewership. Then I will look at the play of basketball and see if there is a correlation between the two.
